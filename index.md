## Favorite CPSC 120 Labs

* Lab 4, Part 2

  This was one of my favorite labs because we used if-else statements to check if the number we typed was equal to the secret number. It was a small game where you could play with your friends which can be fun to play with some people. I also liked how we could code it so that once we get the first guess wrong, we can get another chance to guess it correctly the second time but it was pretty challenging to code at that time.

* Lab 11, Part 2

  This lab was my 2nd favorite lab because it was also another guessing game but instead of player 1 choosing a number like lab 4, it generates a random number that we have to try to guess. It had many of the stuff we’ve been learning for the last few weeks like coding using constructors, if statements, and a return statement that actually works. This lab was hard to code for me because it used constructors and we haven’t really had a lot of time to learn a lot about it during that time but the outcome was worth it.


* Lab 6, Part 2

  This was my 3rd favorite lab to do because we used command line arguments for the first time which was a bit hard but not too hard because of the notes we wrote during class. I liked how it added 2 cards from a deck of cards together and how we could choose any card that exists including the Ace, King and Queen. It was also cool to see cards that aren’t from a deck of cards show an error, so that we know the program is working.
